Imagine you love me,  
Close your eyes and imagine I am loving you,  
Imagine I am breaking your heart,  
Imagine I am killing your hope,  
Imagine I push you so much you take your leave.  

Imagine I call you,  
Imagine you love me again,  
Just close your eyes and imagine you love me again,  
Close your eyes and imagine you love me again.  
And I always imagined you were the one,  
And I imagined being loved the way I love.  

In the chapters of my life,  
I have never been the one,  
Always a choice but never chosen,  
Always a lover, never loved,  
Always an admirer, never the art.  

And with it, she lives in a poetry she can't write,  
And I knew you were gone when I found myself writing about you.  
And if you're thinking about me,  
I'm probably thinking about you.  
You deserve good things, and I want to be one of them.  

But how can I say,  
Am I deserving to say,  
A part of me for once to be the song instead of the voice  
the dance instead of the dancer  
the hope instead of the wish  
the reality instead of the dream  
A part of me for once to be a poem instead of poet  

I’ve always painted you with the colors of my heart,  
A masterpiece of longing and silent cries,  
In the gallery of my soul, you hang,  
A silent witness to my endless sighs.  

Imagine the nights I stayed awake,  
Conjuring worlds where we are together,  
Where your hand fits perfectly in mine,  
And your smile chases away all weather.  
 
Imagine the tears that never fell,  
The words that stayed locked inside,  
Imagine the love that never bloomed,  
The secrets I still hide.  

In my dreams, you are the sunrise,  
The dawn of every new day,  
But in reality, you’re the sunset, 
Fading slowly, slipping away.  

And as I stand on the precipice of hope,  
Looking down into the despair,  
I wonder if you ever truly saw me,  
If you ever really cared.  

Yet here I am, pen in hand,  
Writing lines you'll never read,  
Hoping my heart’s whispers reach you,  
Planting a tiny, hopeful seed.  

Maybe one day you’ll realize,  
In the silence of your own mind,  
That in the chapters of my life,  
You were the only one I always tried to find.  
 
For in the end, we are all poems,  
Written by the threads of fate,  
And I hope that in your chapters,  
There’s a place for me, before it’s too late.  

For I have never been the one,  
I imagine to be one  
For a choice but never chosen,  
I imagine to be chosen  
For a lover, never loved,  
I imagine to be loved  
For an admirer, never the art.  
I imagine to be the art  
I imagine to be with you  

And I say  
A part of me for once imagined to be a poem instead of poet
