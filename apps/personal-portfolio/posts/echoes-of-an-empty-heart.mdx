```

Did love ever find you ?  
I gave it your address  
I said you needed it  
I said you'd been searching for it  
I said I will comfort with it  
and I still wait for it to find you  


I still remember the day  I proposed   
I had cherised the moment more than anything   
I still remember what you said   
you now came to me asking what you had said to me   
to prove someone to be free of guilt   
you simply pushed me to say what you needed me to say   
when you asked what you had said that day   
I still cherish the felling   
but to know that that was the thing that made you feel guilty   
that was your moment of disgust   
that was your moment you will drag until your prove your statement   
I simply will say what you need me to say   
I will simply  be a puppet you nedded   
I still remember the day I purposed    

I still howl at the moon about you.  
your name and all the ways you left, skipping my feelings or yours  
I am none to comment  
All of the physics, science, and nature told me that you were coming back  
every last one of them told me to just wait wait, don't even bother to unpack  

Remember how I used to beg you  
to not stop talking to me  
Well these days  
I blame myself for not begging more  
I blame myself for not begging more  

Someone said  
you cannot pour love into a glass  
that they have covered with their hand  
i tried, I know  
I really tried to fill it  
but it left a mess and I now have to mop it alone  

I gave you heart and  
you gave me a story  
a poem  
A light by which to see  
a light only needed because you gave this dark to me  

I wish you really had it  
my heart I mean my heart  
I wish you had it like fish in a tank  
where you could see what makes it struggle, where you could see what makes it thrive  
where you could see what makes it drive  
the way it beats the way it bleeds  
and where you could see the bruises  
the cracks, the holes, the blood, the hurt  
I wish you could see the hurt  
I wish you really had it  
and I really wish you didn't  

I got to a doc  
I say, doc what's happening to me  
I say what's happening to me  
he presses to the place where my heart should be  
I say is there anything beating in there  
I say is anything bleeding in there  
I say is anything still in there  
I ask is there a chance for me  
will I live  
the doc just silently sits there staring in my teary eyes  
and I just silently sit there as my heart died for you  
so did I  

I visit our graves twice a week  
I' m sorry  
twice a day  
I' m sorry  
I always spend there every night  
I spend an hour smashing  
the tombstone to pieces  
and glue it for hours  
I trace the the letter of our names and mine was engraved deeper than yours  
I trace the beginning and the end date and your ended before even beginning  and mine I still wait for that to end  
I see us laughing  
I see us happy and  
I have never  
felt more alone  

I feel alone  
I pick flowers  
I laugh at it  
I pick flowers I stare at it  
I laugh it off with my friends  
like i really can  
I laugh like I meant it  
but i question myself am i supposed to laugh  
am I deserving to laugh  

I act happy around my new friends  
I laugh  
I joke to give my heart to someone  
I joke to like another person  
I joke to my own feelings  
I act like I am free of you  
I act like I enjoy  
I act like I am dancing and singing with joy  
But then I sit alone  
and  I understand i am not alone but the act of mine is there with me  

Remember I used used to overreact  
I also do it now  
I overreact to be much happy  
I dance with my Friends  
I act like a cool guy  
I act like I am not myself  
but the act is killing me  
I really blame the act  
I really blame me  
for being alone  
as I cannot accept anybody to be close to me I just act everything  
I cannot accept myself to be alone but  
I never felt more alone
