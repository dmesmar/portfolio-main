        <h3>Satisfaction and optimization of constraints for the personalization of gym routines</h3>
        <p>
          <b>
            One of the most common problems when starting the gym is getting used to the machines.
            Over the first weeks, with the help of friends and trainers, it is possible to start thinking about
            the objectives to follow. That is when there is another problem: you must start doing your
            routines. Using some apps or with an internet search you will find a thousand of different
            routines. The most difficult part lies in choosing which routine to follow, which is more friendly
            on your schedule, and which one respects more your preferences, such as avoiding certain
            exercises.

            Most of these problems are solved with a custom routine, paying for a personal trainer. This
            thesis proposes the design of a tool for mobile devices that can generate highly personalized
            routines based on the group of muscles that the user wants to exercise, the available time and
            your preferences. To do this, the app will have a database of exercises, each of which will
            specify the type of exercise, which muscle groups work and how much, rest times after
            completion and the benefit obtained.

            The exercise database together with the restrictions and preferences of the user will be used as
            input to generate, through optimization algorithms and constraint satisfaction, a routine that
            achieves the stated objectives while maximizing the benefit achieved within the time
            constraints.

            Keywords: gym, training routine, optimization, constraint satisfaction, mobile application
